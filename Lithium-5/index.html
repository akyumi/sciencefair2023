                Conventional or hypodermic needles open through various uses across the medical field. Despite its merits, it also brings forth several issues. One of these is the painful and burdensome insertion on the skin because of its reach to the pain receptors, found deep in the dermis (Waghule et al., 2018). Its long and thick nature prevents comfort and appropriateness of its use on body parts with thinner or more delicate skin, including the face or neck. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another is the adverse effects and possible hazards it poses on the patient's skin, which includes the prolonged time of healing of the injection site (Waghule et al., 2018). Skin irritation is one of the most frequently destructive outcomes of conventional needle use. Minor trauma from the needle puncturing of the skin might result in discomfort, redness, and swelling. The likelihood of a needle breaking off and getting stuck in the skin is another potential risk associated with conventional needle use. Given that the needle may need to be surgically removed and poses a risk of infection or other consequences, this can be a painful and risky condition.
                <br>
            </p>
            <img id="img1" class="image-right" src="media/banner.jpg" alt="nature" class="img-fluid w-100" >
            <p>
                <br>
                The use of conventional needles can be a distressing experience for those who have needle phobias or anxiety. Fear of the needle, pain, and discomfort can unsettle patients and keep them from getting the medical attention they need.
                <br><br>
                The administration of these conventional needles can pose harm not only to the patient but also to the administrator. In fact, every year, around two million healthcare professionals get injured by needles after usage. Infection of hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through this is not unusual (Pease, 2014). If not appropriately disposed of, they might not be biodegradable, which could cause environmental issues.
                <br><br>
                Due to these complications, it is imperative to gain and apply new knowledge. Traditional needles might be a frightening thought for many who have trypanophobia, or a fear of needles. However, this science topic engages in the much harmless option — the common mosquito’s sting.
                <br><br>
            </p>

                Thought of mosquito bites, much of the populace often associates them with itchiness, swelling, and the risk of contracting diseases like malaria, dengue fever, or Zika virus. However, beyond these unpleasant consequences, mosquito bites are also intriguing biological phenomena that have attracted the attention of scientists and researchers for decades. One aspect of mosquito bites that scientists have studied in depth is how they affect the human body and why they may be less painful than traditional needle injections.
                <br><br>
                One factor that contributes to the painlessness of mosquito bites is the mosquito's saliva. Mosquitoes secrete saliva that contain proteins, enzymes, and other molecules that help find and access blood vessels in the human body. These molecules numb the skin and reduce inflammation, which can make the bite feel less painful and irritating. In addition, the mosquito's fascicle, which draws up blood from the host, vibrates as it feeds, creating a pulsating sensation that can further distract the human nervous system from feeling the pain.
                <br><br>
                <img id="img3" class="image-right" src="media/banner.jpg" alt="nature" class="img-fluid w-100" >
                <br><br>
                Another feature of mosquito bites that distinguishes them from traditional needle injections is the structure of the mosquito's proboscis, which is the thin and long mouthpart that is used to pierce the skin and suck blood. Unlike traditional needles, which are typically smooth and uniform in shape, the mosquito's proboscis is serrated, with notched edges that resemble saws or teeth. It is thought that their bites barely hurt because the part of their mouth that pierces the skin is thinner than a single hair -- which is about a tenth of a millimeter -- thereby hardly stimulating the sensory neurons (Mainichi Japan, n.d.). This structure allows the mosquito to cut through the skin more easily, minimizing the force and pressure applied to the tissue and reducing the likelihood of pain and injury (Ohio State University, 2018).
                <br><br>
                These observations involving the needle-like structure of mosquitoes inspired several scientists to implement these newfound observations into conventional needles. The merge of these factors and the conventional hypodermic needle led to the birth of the painless microneedle.

            <p>
                Science is a mere collection of knowledge and the processes by which it is advanced. Understanding the scientific concepts involved in a particular topic yields a much richer understanding of the topic at hand. The following are some of the most important scientific concepts involved in this specific research. 
            </p>
            <h5 class="display-8 fst-italic">Biology</h5>
            <p>
                One of the science concepts involved in this topic is biomimicry. Biomimicry is a process wherein one is to observe nature's patterns and tactics to acquire solutions to the world's most compelling problems. The aim is to provide the world with new subsequent knowledge, processes, and mechanisms adapted to ease daily life (Venturini, n.d.). In this topic, scientists applied biomimicry to their observations of the mosquitoes' painless sting. These observations include using a numbing agent, the serrated design of the needle, vibration during insertion, and combined soft and firm parts of the proboscis. These observations involving the mosquito's needle-like structure inspired scientists. Its application to hypodermic needles led to the birth of the painless microneedle. This science concept showed the group that even the operation of the smallest insects can make an impact on human healthcare (Dixon & Vondra, 2022).            </p>
            <p>
                Biocompatibility is a further scientific concept that is involved. Biocompatibility is known as the capacity of a substance or technology to carry out its intended function without triggering a negative reaction in the body. It is the most commonly used term to describe appropriate biological requirements of a biomaterial or biomaterials used in a medical device. Since this specific research was inspired by mosquitos, the microneedle must also be biocompatible and not trigger an adverse reaction in the body, as mosquitoes do. The numbing saliva that mosquitoes release as they bite onto human skin causes the body to respond by itching and producing a bump. So with this, biocompatibility is involved and applied as scientists carefully choose the correct materials to guarantee that it is safe for human skin while yet preserving the beneficial properties of the mosquito's needle (Barrere et al., 2008).                <br>
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h5 class="display-8 fst-italic">Chemistry</h5>
            <p>
                Another scientific concept involved in painless microneedles inspired by mosquitos is capillary action. Capillary action, which is sometimes called capillary force, is determined by three variables. These are the adhesive force, cohesive force, and surface tension. Capillary action only occurs when the adhesive forces are far greater than the cohesive forces. This concept can be observed when a mosquito sucks blood from the human skin. Similarly, in microneedle technology, capillary pressure is the most common microfluidic driving mechanism. Microneedles are able to utilize this mechanism well for they possess outstanding properties for diverse biomedical uses such as the delivery of very large substances with ionic and hydrophilic physicochemical properties (Mdanda et al., 2021). Making use of these microfluidic structures with microneedles enables fluid manipulation capabilities that are utilized in drug delivery. The microchannels created by the microneedles enhance delivery quality. The benefits of this concept offer speed, accuracy, and greater degrees of freedom (Yeung et al., 2019).

            <br><br>
            <h5 class="display-8 fst-italic">Physics</h5>
            <p>
                Kinematics is also involved in this topic. The mosquito’s proboscis emits vibrations that utilize a back-and-forth motion valued at 20-50 hertz frequency, piercing through the skin. The proboscis’ soft tip helps decrease the pressure applied on the skin and causes less skin deformation. Traditional needles, on the other hand, pierce through the skin in one direction which means that all of the force is directed onto one spot. The pain experienced in needle pricking mainly depends on two factors: the force applied, and the ability of the skin to resist force.  The greater the resistance of the skin, the higher the pain. This is the reason why the puncture of traditional needles causes higher pain compared to mosquito bites. Thus, specific-shaped needles inspired by a mosquito's sting were created to reduce this resistance by half (Kanpur, 2019).

                <h2 class="display-6 fst-italic">Application</h2>
            </hgroup>
            <p>
                Due to their observable merits, painless microneedles are implied and incorporated into society's services. It is mainly utilized and implemented categorically in healthcare services. Below are its usage and application to the community:
            </p>
            <p>
                Microneedles were mainly introduced for skin rejuvenation. It involves the pricking of the skin with miniature needles in order for the body to produce more collagen and elastin which results in a healthier look of the skin, this process is also known as Collagen Induction Therapy (CIT).
                <br>
            </p>
            <img id="img4" class="image-left" src="media/banner.jpg" alt="nature" class="img-fluid w-100" >
            <p>
            <br>
                Cancer, like many illnesses, requires diagnosis and treatment that includes using needles. Far from the conventional approach, microneedles provide multitudes of benefits, such as self-administration, painless treatment, and being economically and environmentally friendly, thus, providing a safer and more effective cancer diagnosis and treatment. The benefits acquired from these microneedles remarkably improved the survival rate of cancer patients (Ganeson et al., 2023).
            <br><br>
                Another illness that plagued many is diabetes. Health professionals urge diabetics to have regular glucose monitoring and drug insertion. The execution of these processes suggests a repetitive administration of needles. It can be the origin of the pain of the mentioned diabetics. Due to this recurring problem, the implementation of painless microneedles in diabetes management emerged as a more efficient process of drawing blood and delivering the drug. Hence, painless microneedles in diabetes treatment enable health workers to provide complex drugs to diabetics conveniently and comfortably (Uddin et al., 2018).
            </p>
            <img id="img5" class="image-right" src="media/banner.jpg" alt="nature" class="img-fluid w-100" >
            <p>
                <br>
                Microneedling is used to treat a variety of skin conditions that cause depressions in the skin such as acne scarring, surgical scars, other scars, burns, enlarged pores, wrinkles, and stretch marks. It also does not deliver heat to the skin like lasers do. As a result, people who have melasma (dark patches of skin) and hyperpigmentation (dark spots on the skin) can undergo microneedling without the risk of worsening pigmentation problems. It is also sometimes used to help topical skin treatments to penetrate the skin more effectively. For example, microneedling is sometimes performed before application of minoxidil, used to treat common hair loss.
                <br><br>
                <img id="img6" class="image-left" src="media/banner.jpg" alt="nature" class="img-fluid w-100" >
                <br><br>
                Overall, microneedles, anticipated by their minuscule nature, deliver painless insertion and removal. The patient's comfort in administration could potentially lead to greater acceptance and compliance (Federico et al., 2023). The enduring ambition of the medical field is to make its mechanisms accessible to a much greater populace. Thus, making painless microneedles accessible and drug delivery more accessible.            </p>
