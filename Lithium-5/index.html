                Conventional or hypodermic needles open through various uses across the medical field. Despite its merits, it also brings forth several issues. One of these is the painful and burdensome insertion on the skin because of its reach to the pain receptors, found deep in the dermis (Waghule et al., 2018). Its long and thick nature prevents comfort and appropriateness of its use on body parts with thinner or more delicate skin, including the face or neck. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Another is the adverse effects and possible hazards it poses on the patient's skin, which includes the prolonged time of healing of the injection site (Waghule et al., 2018). Skin irritation is one of the most frequently destructive outcomes of conventional needle use. Minor trauma from the needle puncturing of the skin might result in discomfort, redness, and swelling. The likelihood of a needle breaking off and getting stuck in the skin is another potential risk associated with conventional needle use. Given that the needle may need to be surgically removed and poses a risk of infection or other consequences, this can be a painful and risky condition.

                <br>
                The use of conventional needles can be a distressing experience for those who have needle phobias or anxiety. Fear of the needle, pain, and discomfort can unsettle patients and keep them from getting the medical attention they need.
                <br><br>
                The administration of these conventional needles can pose harm not only to the patient but also to the administrator. In fact, every year, around two million healthcare professionals get injured by needles after usage. Infection of hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through this is not unusual (Pease, 2014). If not appropriately disposed of, they might not be biodegradable, which could cause environmental issues.
                <br><br>
                Due to these complications, it is imperative to gain and apply new knowledge. Traditional needles might be a frightening thought for many who have trypanophobia, or a fear of needles. However, this science topic engages in the much harmless option — the common mosquito’s sting.

                Thought of mosquito bites, much of the populace often associates them with itchiness, swelling, and the risk of contracting diseases like malaria, dengue fever, or Zika virus. However, beyond these unpleasant consequences, mosquito bites are also intriguing biological phenomena that have attracted the attention of scientists and researchers for decades. One aspect of mosquito bites that scientists have studied in depth is how they affect the human body and why they may be less painful than traditional needle injections.
                <br><br>
                One factor that contributes to the painlessness of mosquito bites is the mosquito's saliva. Mosquitoes secrete saliva that contain proteins, enzymes, and other molecules that help find and access blood vessels in the human body. These molecules numb the skin and reduce inflammation, which can make the bite feel less painful and irritating. In addition, the mosquito's fascicle, which draws up blood from the host, vibrates as it feeds, creating a pulsating sensation that can further distract the human nervous system from feeling the pain.
                <br><br>
                <img id="img3" class="image-right" src="media/banner.jpg" alt="nature" class="img-fluid w-100" >
                <br><br>
                Another feature of mosquito bites that distinguishes them from traditional needle injections is the structure of the mosquito's proboscis, which is the thin and long mouthpart that is used to pierce the skin and suck blood. Unlike traditional needles, which are typically smooth and uniform in shape, the mosquito's proboscis is serrated, with notched edges that resemble saws or teeth. It is thought that their bites barely hurt because the part of their mouth that pierces the skin is thinner than a single hair -- which is about a tenth of a millimeter -- thereby hardly stimulating the sensory neurons (Mainichi Japan, n.d.). This structure allows the mosquito to cut through the skin more easily, minimizing the force and pressure applied to the tissue and reducing the likelihood of pain and injury (Ohio State University, 2018).
                <br><br>
                These observations involving the needle-like structure of mosquitoes inspired several scientists to implement these newfound observations into conventional needles. The merge of these factors and the conventional hypodermic needle led to the birth of the painless microneedle.
