                        Pollution is a growing problem within today’s world. Cars, factories, and other human activities
                        release various pollutants into the atmosphere. One of these is <b>carbon dioxide</b>. While
                        this gas is naturally produced by humans and animals, too much of it traps heat into the
                        atmosphere, speeding up global warming and slowly destroying the environment.

                        The most common method of removing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is through planting
                        trees. This is because plants and trees can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen in a process
                        called <b>photosynthesis.</b> Photosynthesis is very important in balancing an ecosystem, since
                        plants can absorb the excess carbon dioxide produced by humans and animals and in turn produce
                        oxygen for those humans and animals to breathe. For this reason, plants and trees are described
                        as the "lungs of the earth."

                        Hopefully, after reading through our research, you will get to see the amazing potential that
                        algae holds in helping the environment. Who knows; maybe future scientists such as you will be
                        able to make innovations with algae in the future!

                <p id="algaepower-desc">The Power of Algae</p>
                <div id="algaepower">
                    <p>
                        The main reason why algae produce so much oxygen is because of their high photosynthetic
                        efficiency. <b>Photosynthetic efficiency</b> means the amount light a plant captures and
                        successfully converts into useful products (Park, 2007), including oxygen. They are more
                        efficient at photosynthesis because they have more pigments that capture solar energy and are
                        better at concentrating carbon dioxide (Ma et al., 2023).
                        The result of this is that algae have a photosynthetic efficiency of 10-20%, while plants have
                        an efficiency of about 1-2%. That means algae can produce 10x more oxygen than plants do!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Algae also have several other benefits. They are more tolerant of carbon dioxide, meaning that
                        they can be used in highly polluted areas. They have low light intensity requirements, they are
                        not as constrained by land as plants are, and do not require herbicides or pesticides. Algae
                        also grow at incredible rates—some species can double their growth in just 3.5 hours!

                        Dubbed by the Internet as "liquid trees", LIQUID3 is a "photo-bio reactor" that uses algae to clean
                        the atmosphere, especially in highly polluted cities such as the Serbian capital of Belgrade. It is
                        designed to be an innovative and practical way of reducing pollution, especially in cities where there isn't enough space to plant trees.

                        Algae holds a lot of potential in our fight against climate change and greenhouse gases. They
                        produce 10 times more oxygen than plants, and thus capture 10 times more carbon dioxide from the
                        atmosphere. They have several benefits that make them practical for use in highly-polluted urban
                        areas where planting trees is not always feasible. They have already seen use all over the world,
                        and they will be a key part of our fight against climate change in the near future.
